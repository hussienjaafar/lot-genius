# Stage 06: UI/UX Upgrade

## Overview

Enhanced the frontend with clean UI components and lightweight charts without adding dependencies. Created a complete calibration analysis page with client-side parsing and metrics computation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Reusable UI Components (frontend/components/)

Created 7 production-ready components following design system patterns:

- **MetricCard.tsx**: Stat display with hints, deltas, and flexible value formatting
- **ProgressBar.tsx**: Labeled progress component with accessibility features
- **SparkArea.tsx**: SVG area chart implementation for trend visualization
- **BinBarChart.tsx**: Complex calibration bins chart with bias overlay visualization
- **Section.tsx**: Container component with title, description, and optional actions
- **FilePicker.tsx**: Drag/drop file input with validation and visual feedback
- **SseConsole.tsx**: Real-time event stream display with auto-scroll

All components use Tailwind utility classes and maintain TypeScript strict compliance.

### 2. Enhanced Home Page (frontend/app/page.tsx)

- Added tabbed interface with "Optimize Lot" and "Pipeline (SSE)" tabs
- Optimize tab: Clean form with metrics display and progress tracking
- SSE tab: Real-time streaming pipeline monitoring with event console
- Integrated file upload with size validation and progress indicators
- Added comprehensive result visualization with MetricCard grid

### 3. Calibration Analysis Page (frontend/app/calibration/page.tsx)

Complete client-side implementation without backend dependencies:

- JSONL/CSV file parsing and validation
- Join predictions with outcomes on sku_local
- Brier score computation for probability calibration
- Price metrics: MAE, MAPE, RMSE
- Calibration bins (0.1 wide) with bias analysis
- Interactive chart visualization using BinBarChart component
- Downloadable JSON reports with timestamp

### 4. API Utilities (frontend/lib/api.ts)

Enhanced with file processing helpers:

- `readFileAsText()`: Promise-based FileReader wrapper
- `parseSimpleCSV()`: Lightweight CSV parser for basic use cases
- `parseJSONL()`: JSONL parser with error handling
- `streamReport()`: SSE event streaming with proper frame parsing
- Updated `SseEvent` interface and event extraction logic

### 5. Layout Updates (frontend/app/layout.tsx)

- Added navigation bar with Home and Calibration links
- Clean header design with brand consistency
- Responsive layout with proper spacing

### 6. Configuration Fixes

- Fixed ESLint configuration conflicts between root and frontend
- Added `"root": true` to frontend/.eslintrc.json to override parent config
- Fixed TypeScript error in proxy.ts with `@ts-ignore` for Node.js duplex property

## Technical Highlights

### Inline SVG Charts

All charts implemented using pure SVG without external dependencies:

- Responsive viewBox scaling
- Dynamic color schemes for bias visualization
- Tooltip support and accessibility features
- Grid lines and axis labels for professional appearance

### Client-Side Data Processing

Calibration page performs all computation client-side:

- File parsing and validation
- Statistical calculations (Brier, MAE, RMSE, MAPE)
- Probability binning and bias analysis
- No server round-trips for computation

### Type Safety

All components maintain strict TypeScript compliance:

- Comprehensive interface definitions
- Proper error handling with type guards
- Null safety for optional properties

## Testing Results

### Frontend Checks

```bash
npm run lint  # ✔ No ESLint warnings or errors
npm run build # ✓ Compiled successfully - 5 pages generated
```

### Component Verification

- All 7 components render without errors
- File upload validation working correctly
- Chart rendering with proper scaling
- SSE streaming functional
