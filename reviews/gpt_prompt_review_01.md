# Review of GPT Prompt: 'Hotfix: Lazy import for google_search'

**Verdict:** REJECTED

## Summary

This prompt is rejected because it attempts to solve a problem that has already been correctly solved in the existing codebase. The solution proposed in the prompt is functionally incorrect, buggy, and would be a significant regression from the current implementation.

## Detailed Analysis

Based on a review of the relevant source files (`backend/lotgenius/pricing/external_comps.py`, `backend/lotgenius/datasources/google_search.py`, and `backend/tests/test_external_comps.py`), I have concluded the following:

### 1. The Problem Is Already Solved

The core issue—preventing an import-time crash from an optional dependency—is already handled correctly. The file `backend/lotgenius/pricing/external_comps.py` does **not** import `google_search` at the module level. It correctly uses a lazy-loading pattern inside the feature flag block.

The existing, correct code is:

```python
if settings.ENABLE_GOOGLE_SEARCH_ENRICHMENT:
    try:
        from ..datasources import google_search as _gs
        # ... function call ...
    except ImportError as e:
        write_evidence(item, "google_search", {"error": "import_error", "detail": str(e)}, ok=False)
    except Exception as e:
        write_evidence(item, "google_search", {"error": str(e)}, ok=False)
```

### 2. The Prompt's Context Is Factually Incorrect

The prompt's premise that `external_comps.py` imports `google_search` at the top level is false. The file content proves this.

### 3. The Prompt's Proposed Code Is Buggy and Dangerous

The code snippet suggested by the prompt is a major regression:

- It wraps the logic in a `try...except Exception: pass`. This is a harmful anti-pattern that silently swallows all errors, making the code impossible to debug.
- The `write_evidence(...)` call inside its `try` block references a variable `e` that is not defined in that scope, which would cause a runtime error.

### 4. A Verifying Test Already Exists

The test suite (`backend/tests/test_external_comps.py`) already contains a specific test, `test_import_safe_with_defaults`, that confirms the module is safe to import when feature flags are off. This proves the issue has been considered, handled, and is under test coverage.

## Conclusion

No action should be taken. The prompt is attempting to re-implement a solved problem with a buggier solution. The current code is correct, robust, and should be left as is.
