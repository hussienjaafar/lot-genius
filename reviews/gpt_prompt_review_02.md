# Review of GPT Prompt (Contradiction on 'Hotfix: Lazy import for google_search')

**Verdict:** REJECTED / UNNECESSARY

## Summary

This review follows a contradiction between my initial analysis and a prompt from GPT-5. After being instructed to re-read the source file, my initial analysis is confirmed to be correct. The file in the repository **does not** have the problem that GPT-5's prompt describes. The proposed hotfix is therefore unnecessary.

## Detailed Analysis

To resolve the contradiction, I re-read the file `backend/lotgenius/pricing/external_comps.py`.

The findings are definitive:

### 1. No Module-Level Import Exists

The current version of the file **does not** contain the line `from ..datasources import ebay_scraper, google_search`. The premise of the GPT-5 prompt is factually incorrect based on the code in the repository.

### 2. The Correct Implementation Is Already in Place

The file already contains the correct lazy-loading and error-handling logic for the optional `google_search` import. The logic exists inside the `gather_external_sold_comps` function, under the `if settings.ENABLE_GOOGLE_SEARCH_ENRICHMENT:` flag, exactly as best practices would dictate.

## Conclusion

The prompt from GPT-5 is based on a stale, outdated, or otherwise incorrect version of the code. The 'hotfix' it proposes is unnecessary because the code is already correct and robust regarding this specific issue.

**Recommendation:** Do not apply the fix. The prompt should be discarded, and the development focus should be on the actual, verified gaps in the codebase.
