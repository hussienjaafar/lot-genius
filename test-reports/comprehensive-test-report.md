# üìä Lot Genius - Comprehensive End-to-End Test Report

**Test Date:** 2025-08-23
**Tester:** Claude Code
**Test Scope:** Full end-to-end application testing using Playwright and direct Python testing

## Executive Summary

I conducted comprehensive end-to-end testing of the Lot Genius application using Playwright for UI testing and direct Python testing for backend components. The system shows strong technical architecture with well-functioning statistical models, but has critical integration issues that prevent full pipeline operation.

## üéØ Key Findings

### ‚úÖ **WORKING COMPONENTS**

- Backend API infrastructure (FastAPI, SSE streaming)
- Statistical pricing models (condition factors, triangulation)
- Survival modeling (log-logistic, sell-through probabilities)
- Monte Carlo ROI optimization (bisection search, risk analysis)
- Calibration system (JSONL logging, metrics computation)
- Frontend UI navigation and layout
- **Keepa API Integration** (‚úÖ Connected with valid API key)
- **All Scrapers Enabled** (‚úÖ eBay, Facebook, Google Search active)

### ‚ùå **CRITICAL ISSUES**

- **Frontend file upload broken** - Files selected but not transmitted to backend
- **Header mapping issue** - UPC and ASIN columns merged preventing proper ID resolution
- **Pipeline blocked on ID extraction** - Valid ASINs not reaching Keepa API due to parsing

### üîÑ **BLOCKED/UNTESTABLE**

- Complete end-to-end pipeline (blocked on header mapping)
- External scrapers in practice (require successful ID resolution first)

## üö® Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. Header Mapping Issue (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

- **Problem**: CSV parser merges UPC and ASIN columns into single `upc_ean_asin` field
- **Impact**: Prevents proper ASIN extraction for Keepa API lookups
- **Evidence**: ASINs like `B0863TXGM3` found in data but not extracted to `asin` column
- **Solution**: Fix header mapping logic to preserve separate identifier columns

### 2. Frontend File Upload (HIGH PRIORITY)

- **Problem**: UI file selection doesn't trigger backend upload
- **Impact**: Users cannot process manifests through web interface
- **Solution**: Debug multipart form data handling in frontend

### 3. Unicode Encoding Issues (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

- **Problem**: Console encoding errors on Windows preventing some error testing
- **Impact**: Limited ability to test edge cases interactively
- **Solution**: Review character encoding in CLI tools and help text
