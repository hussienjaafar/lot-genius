2. **Command Line** (for automation and debugging)
3. **Python Script** (for custom business logic)

**Real-World Context**:

- Expected timelines by manifest size
- Performance benchmarks and optimization tips
- Evidence quality interpretation
- Cost structure examples

## Specialized Guides

### Calibration Cycle (60-90 Days)

**Complete Workflow**:

1. **Phase 1**: Enable prediction logging during optimization
2. **Phase 2**: Outcome collection (manual and automated methods)
3. **Phase 3**: Analysis and metrics computation
4. **Phase 4**: Model refinement and deployment

**Practical Implementation**:

- File naming conventions and storage organization
- Data collection templates and validation
- Automated pipeline scripts for monthly analysis
- Alert thresholds for model degradation

### Troubleshooting Guide

**Comprehensive Coverage**:

- Environment setup issues (Python, API keys, paths)
- File processing problems (headers, validation, encoding)
- Network and API issues (rate limits, timeouts)
- Performance problems (memory, optimization convergence)

**Diagnostic Approach**:

- Clear symptom descriptions
- Step-by-step investigation procedures
- Multiple solution approaches
- Recovery procedures for corrupted state

### Development Guidelines

**Code Quality Standards**:

- Style requirements (Black, TypeScript strict)
- Testing requirements (unit, integration, e2e)
- Documentation standards with examples
- Security guidelines for API keys and input validation

**Contribution Process**:

- Branch naming conventions
- Commit message format (conventional commits)
- PR template with self-review checklist
- Multi-agent development with run logs

## Example Files Quality

### optimizer.json

**Comprehensive Template**:

- All 20+ parameters documented with inline comments
- Example profiles (conservative, standard, aggressive)
- Category-specific cost structures
- Range validation and typical values

**Educational Value**:

- Parameter interaction explanations
- Business context for each setting
- Common configuration patterns
- Risk/return trade-off examples

### synthetic_outcomes.csv

**Realistic Data**:

- 25 sample records with 60% sell-through rate
- Various marketplaces (eBay, Amazon)
- Return occurrences (realistic 8% rate)
- Price distribution matching typical electronics

**Integration Ready**:

- Matches expected JSONL prediction format
- Complete column set for analysis
- Proper date formatting and boolean values

## Documentation Integration

### Cross-References

**Comprehensive Linking**:

- Each runbook links to relevant technical documentation
- Examples reference detailed parameter guides
- Troubleshooting links to specific diagnostic commands

**Navigation Patterns**:

- Quick access sections in INDEX.md

- Consistent back-navigation to main index

### Windows-Specific Considerations

**Command Syntax**:

- Windows `cmd` examples with `^` line continuation
- PowerShell alternatives where appropriate
- Path format handling (forward slashes vs backslashes)
- Environment variable syntax (`%VAR%` vs `$VAR`)

**File System**:

- Absolute path examples using Windows conventions
- Path safety validation explaining Windows-specific blocks
- Directory creation and permission handling

- Python 3.13 as standard runtime
- Next.js 14 with App Router for frontend

**Operational Context**:

- Single-user development setup initially
- Keepa API as primary data source

### Documentation Limitations

**Dynamic Content**:

- API schemas may evolve (documented as of Step 6 state)
- Environment variables may expand with new features
- CLI commands reflect current backend structure

**Integration Testing**:

- Full end-to-end workflow not executed (requires API keys)
- Some examples are synthetic rather than real-world tested
- Performance benchmarks are estimates based on system design
